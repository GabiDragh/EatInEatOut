# EatInEatOut
Personal project to incorporate Bootcamp skills learned so far - HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, Figma.

App that gives parents the option to eat in or out with their children. 
One page uses API calls to generate baby/toddler appropriate healthy recipes, based on child age, ingredients available or the dish desired.
The other page looks for places to eat out based on a selected dish and healthy recipes. 

App is under development, in early stages at the moment.
